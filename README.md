nrsyncd ‚Äì 802.11k Neighbor Report Sync Daemon üõú
======================================================

Distributes per‚ÄëBSS 802.11k Neighbor Report data across a set of OpenWrt APs using mDNS so clients (and higher‚Äëlevel steering logic) can discover other BSSes of the same ESS quickly. Client support of 802.11k is required for full functionality and support varies by client device manufacturer and operating system.

For clients supporting 802.11k, this project provides a way to efficiently and automatically share neighbor report data across multiple access points, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of roaming between bands and BSSes.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è As this project is heavily reliant on OpenWrt's `ubus` and `hostapd` components, it is designed to work seamlessly within the OpenWrt ecosystem. However, the specific requirement for `ubus` inhibits the usage of this project in non-OpenWrt environments.

## Acknowledgements üèÖ

Inspiration for this `nrsyncd` project comes from pioneering efforts by [Kiss √Åd√°m](https://github.com/kissadamfkut) in the [openwrt-rrm-nr-distributor](https://github.com/simonyiszk/openwrt-rrm-nr-distributor) project. This project represents a significant evolution in the approach to 802.11k neighbor report synchronization as envisioned and established by √Åd√°m in the former project beginning back in August 2021. Many thanks to √Åd√°m for allowing this `nrsyncd` project to be spawned from [openwrt-rrm-nr-distributor](https://github.com/simonyiszk/openwrt-rrm-nr-distributor) and continue the growth and evolution of 802.11k neighbor reporting.

#### Provenance

*nrsyncd* is an extracted and renamed continuation of the refactored [‚ÄúNeighbor Report Distributor‚Äù (rrm_nr) project](https://github.com/simonyiszk/openwrt-rrm-nr-distributor). It was released as *nrsyncd v1.0.0* under GPLv2 with permission. Legacy names are intentionally not retained.

## Features ‚ú®

- Multi‚Äëradio / multi‚Äëband support (sequential `SSIDn=` TXT records)
- TXT metadata appended after SSID entries: `v=1`, `c=<count>`, `h=<8hex>` (extensible; safe for consumers to ignore unknown keys)
- Helps band / BSS steering by advertising sibling BSS information
- Works once `umdns` is functioning (no extra controller needed)
- Minimal logging (single tag `nrsyncd`) but enough to diagnose startup
- Deterministic neighbor list ordering (by SSID then BSSID) & duplicate suppression (remote duplicates collapsed)
- Per‚Äëinterface neighbor counts (post self‚Äëfilter) exposed as metrics
- Concise one‚Äëline `summary` command (easy monitoring / telemetry)
- Metrics reset (`reset_metrics`) & on‚Äëdemand refresh (`refresh`)
- Baseline per‚ÄëSSID push guarantees initial hostapd population even with no diff
- Remote uniqueness tracking (cycle + cumulative) for observability of discovery breadth
 - Remote installer mode (stage & execute over SSH with a single command)

## Architecture üèó	Ô∏è

Component | Purpose
----------|--------
`service/nrsyncd.init` | procd init script: gathers NR data via `ubus`, formats TXT args, registers mDNS service
`bin/nrsyncd` | Opaque daemon consuming positional `SSIDn=<value>` args (prebuilt; no source here)
`lib/nrsyncd_common.sh` | Shared POSIX helpers (adaptive retry, iface mapping, millisecond sleep abstraction, probes)
`examples/wireless.config` | Example `/etc/config/wireless` enabling 802.11k (`ieee80211k '1'`, `bss_transition '1'`)

### Data Flow Summary üîÄ

1. Count enabled `wifi-iface` stanzas (skip those with `option disabled '1'`).
2. Wait until that many `hostapd.*` objects appear on `ubus` (ensures hostapd ready).
3. For each `hostapd.*`: call `ubus call <obj> rrm_nr_get_own` (method name unchanged) ‚Üí JSON `{"value":"..."}`.
4. Build concatenated string `+SSID<n>=<value>` (delimiter `+` chosen because invalid in SSIDs) then split into positional args.
5. Start daemon & register versioned mDNS service `nrsyncd_v1` (type `_nrsyncd_v1._udp`) on UDP/32025 with those TXT records (all `SSIDn=` first, then metadata `v/c/h`). Legacy `_rrm_nr._udp` is browsed only as a fallback for discovery.

## Legacy Note üìú

A helper script `scripts/migrate_from_rrm_nr.sh` exists for older deployments but is not required for fresh installs.

Installer behavior with legacy rrm_nr:
- On a live system (no `--prefix`) if legacy `rrm_nr` config/service is detected and `/etc/config/nrsyncd` is not present, `scripts/install.sh` aborts to avoid a mixed state.
- To proceed, either run `sh scripts/migrate_from_rrm_nr.sh` first, or re-run the installer with `--auto-migrate-legacy` to migrate automatically.

### Upgrade from rrm_nr (Quick start) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Follow these minimal steps on an existing device running the legacy rrm_nr service:

```sh
# 0) (Optional) stop legacy service before changes
[ -x /etc/init.d/rrm_nr ] && /etc/init.d/rrm_nr stop || true

# 1) Migrate config (safe, idempotent). This also disables the old service when possible.
sh scripts/migrate_from_rrm_nr.sh
# Or do it one-shot during install:
# sh scripts/install.sh --auto-migrate-legacy

# 2) Install nrsyncd (enables/starts service by default)
sh scripts/install.sh

# 3) Validate runtime and mDNS
logread | grep nrsyncd
/etc/init.d/nrsyncd status
ubus call umdns browse | jsonfilter -e '@["_nrsyncd_v1._udp"][*].txt[*]'
	# Tip: arrays in jsonfilter need [*]; omitting it often yields an empty []

# 4) (Recommended) Remove legacy artifacts after validation
sh scripts/migrate_from_rrm_nr.sh --remove-old --force

# 5) (Optional) Persist files across firmware upgrades
sh scripts/install.sh --add-sysupgrade --no-start
	# Adds runtime paths to /etc/sysupgrade.conf:
	#   /etc/init.d/nrsyncd
	#   /usr/bin/nrsyncd
	#   /lib/nrsyncd_common.sh
	# Note: /etc/config is persisted by OpenWrt by default, so /etc/config/nrsyncd is not added explicitly.
```

Notes:
- Remote installs also support migration via `--auto-migrate-legacy` (forward this flag with your remote run).
- The migration helper won‚Äôt modify your wireless config; ensure 802.11k/BSS transition are enabled per the example.

## Installation üíæ

You have three progressively more automated options (plus a remote orchestration helper):

### 1. Quick Scripted Install (Local, Recommended) üë©‚Äçüíª

On the target OpenWrt device (copy the repo over or clone with git if available):

```sh
# assuming repository now at /tmp/nrsyncd_src (e.g. scp -r ./ root@ap:/tmp/nrsyncd_src )
cd /tmp/nrsyncd_src
sh scripts/install.sh
```

Options:
- `--no-start` only stage files (don‚Äôt enable/start service)
- `--force-config` overwrite existing `/etc/config/nrsyncd`
- `--add-sysupgrade` append required paths to `/etc/sysupgrade.conf` for persistence
- `--prefix /overlay` stage into another root (image build workflows)
 - `--deps-auto-yes` / `--deps-auto-no` non‚Äëinteractive dependency handling
 - `--install-optional` install high‚Äëresolution sleep helper (coreutils-sleep or coreutils)
 - `--fix-wireless` auto-enable missing 802.11k / BSS transition options
 - `--auto-migrate-legacy` if legacy `rrm_nr` is detected on a live system, migrate it automatically instead of aborting

### Remote Install From Your Workstation üì°

Run the installer locally and have it stage + execute itself on one or more remote OpenWrt hosts over SSH (no manual scp required). The script:
1. Builds a minimal file set + a `sha256` manifest.
2. Streams a tar archive over SSH to each host (parallel sequentially, one after another).
3. Verifies integrity via `sha256sum -c` on the target (warns & skips verification if `sha256sum` absent).
4. Executes the same `install.sh` remotely with preserved non-remote flags.
5. Optionally cleans up the staging directory.

Examples:

```sh
# Basic (defaults to root user if user@ not provided)
sh scripts/install.sh --remote ap1

# Multiple hosts (comma or repeat) + auto dependency install + optional extras
sh scripts/install.sh --remote ap1,ap2,ap3 --deps-auto-yes --install-optional
sh scripts/install.sh --remote ap1 --remote ap2 --remote ap3 --force-config

# Remote with automatic legacy migration if detected on targets
sh scripts/install.sh --remote ap1,ap2 --auto-migrate-legacy

# Custom SSH port + force config + integrity check (automatic)
sh scripts/install.sh --remote ap1 --ssh-opts '-p 2222' --force-config

# Dry-run (prints plan, hashes, commands; makes no changes)
sh scripts/install.sh --remote ap1,ap2 --remote-dry-run

# Keep staging directory for inspection
sh scripts/install.sh --remote root@ap1 --remote-keep

# Alternate staging directory
sh scripts/install.sh --remote ap1 --remote-prefix /tmp/nrsyncd_stage_alt
```

Remote control flags (not forwarded to the target invocation):

Flag | Purpose | Default
-----|---------|--------
`--remote <host[,host2]>` | Enable remote mode for one or many hosts (comma or repeat) | (off)
`--remote-prefix <dir>` | Staging directory on target | `/tmp/nrsyncd_remote`
`--remote-keep` | Retain staging directory after success | (removed)
`--ssh-opts "..."` | Extra SSH options (port, identity, etc.) | (none)
`--remote-dry-run` | Show plan + hashes, exit without changes | (off)
`--remote-retries <n>` | Retry count per host (exponential backoff) | 1
`--remote-backoff <s>` | Base seconds for backoff (2,4,8...) | 2

All other standard flags (`--force-config`, `--no-start`, `--deps-auto-yes`, etc.) are preserved and applied on the remote side.

Notes:
- Requires `ssh` & `tar` locally and `tar` on the target (present on typical OpenWrt images).
- Integrity: Uses `sha256sum -c` on the target. If absent remotely, a warning is emitted and install proceeds (consider `opkg install coreutils-sha256sum`).
- Multi-host executes sequentially; failures on one host do not halt others (overall exit code reflects any failure).
- Retry logic: Each host retried up to `--remote-retries` times; delay sequence = base, base*2, base*4, ... using `--remote-backoff` as the starting seconds.
- Dry-run still generates a manifest locally then removes it (no remote connections made).
- Missing optional files are noted but not fatal.
- Failures leave the staging directory intact for that host (unless missing connectivity precluded creation).
 - Legacy note: remote installs will also abort on legacy `rrm_nr` unless `--auto-migrate-legacy` is included in the forwarded flags.

### 2. Manual Copy (Minimalistic) üì†

1. Ensure radios share a common ESSID where you want neighbor data propagated.
2. Enable 802.11k + BSS transition in each interface:
	- `option ieee80211k '1'`
	- `option bss_transition '1'`
3. Ensure `umdns` is installed & running (`opkg install umdns`).
4. Copy files:
	```sh
	cp service/nrsyncd.init /etc/init.d/nrsyncd
	cp bin/nrsyncd /usr/bin/nrsyncd
	cp lib/nrsyncd_common.sh /lib/nrsyncd_common.sh 2>/dev/null || true
	chmod +x /etc/init.d/nrsyncd /usr/bin/nrsyncd
	/etc/init.d/nrsyncd enable
	/etc/init.d/nrsyncd start
	```
5. Verify basic operation:
	```sh
	logread | grep nrsyncd
	ubus call umdns browse | grep SSID1=
	/etc/init.d/nrsyncd status
	```

### Post-Install Checklist ‚úÖ

- `logread | grep nrsyncd` shows a line "All wireless interfaces are initialized." followed by periodic update lines (if debug enabled).
- `ubus call umdns browse` contains TXT records `SSID1=...` etc.
- `/etc/init.d/nrsyncd status` shows current effective runtime values.
- `/etc/init.d/nrsyncd summary` prints concise counters & ratios.
- `/etc/init.d/nrsyncd reset_metrics` clears metrics & remote uniqueness (SIGUSR2).
- Install script warnings: if any `wifi-iface` lacks `ieee80211k '1'` or `bss_transition '1'` (and is not disabled) you will see a WARNING prompting you to enable them for proper neighbor reports.

### Quick Debug / Tuning Snippets ‚öôÔ∏è

Enable debug logging at runtime (no restart):
```sh
uci set nrsyncd.global.debug=1
uci commit nrsyncd
/etc/init.d/nrsyncd reload
```
Temporarily shorten update + jitter for lab testing (DON'T use in production extremely low values):
```sh
uci set nrsyncd.global.update_interval=15
uci set nrsyncd.global.jitter_max=3
uci commit nrsyncd; /etc/init.d/nrsyncd reload
```
Restore defaults:
```sh
uci delete nrsyncd.global.update_interval
uci delete nrsyncd.global.jitter_max
uci delete nrsyncd.global.debug
uci commit nrsyncd; /etc/init.d/nrsyncd reload
```

### Uninstall

```sh
/etc/init.d/nrsyncd stop
/etc/init.d/nrsyncd disable
rm -f /etc/init.d/nrsyncd /usr/bin/nrsyncd /lib/nrsyncd_common.sh
# Optional: remove config/state
rm -f /etc/config/nrsyncd /tmp/nrsyncd_runtime /tmp/nrsyncd_metrics
```

### ‚ûï Optional micro-sleep (usleep) dependency

The init script performs a short adaptive retry loop (200ms cadence, ‚â§1s total) when gathering initial `rrm_nr_get_own` values. On typical vanilla OpenWrt images `usleep` is NOT present (BusyBox `sleep` has 1s resolution). The script automatically detects this:

* If `usleep` exists (e.g. via `busybox-extras` or `coreutils-sleep`), it sleeps for true 200ms steps.
* If absent, it degrades to a single 1s sleep (effectively a one-shot retry). Elapsed accounting ensures we still bound total wait time.

Installing a micro-sleep implementation (optional):
```
opkg update
opkg install coreutils-sleep   # or a busybox providing usleep
```
This is purely an optimization; functionality still works without it, but initial readiness detection may be up to ~1s slower on hardware where readiness is actually ~0.2s.

## Configuration (UCI) üîß

Config file `/etc/config/nrsyncd`:

```
config nrsyncd 'global'
	option enabled '1'                 # Set to 0 to disable service startup
	option update_interval '60'        # Seconds between update cycles (min 5 enforced)
	option jitter_max '10'             # Adds 0..jitter_max random seconds each cycle (capped at half interval)
	option debug '0'                   # Set to 1 for verbose debug logging (daemon.debug)
	option umdns_refresh_interval '30' # Minimum seconds between umdns update calls
	option umdns_settle_delay '0'      # Extra seconds to sleep immediately after an umdns update (default 0)
	# Advanced (optional) readiness tuning (normally leave defaults):
	# option quick_max_ms '2000'        # Max ms spent in first-pass adaptive readiness (cap 5000)
	# option second_pass_ms '800'       # Delay ms before second-pass fetch (cap 1500)

	# Skip specific interfaces (add one line per interface). Names are the part after 'hostapd.'
	# Duplicates and ordering are normalized automatically. Optional 'hostapd.' prefixes are stripped.
	# Examples:
	# list skip_iface 'wlan0'
	# list skip_iface 'wlan1-1'
	# list skip_iface 'hostapd.phy0-ap1'   # 'hostapd.' prefix accepted
	# To remove a previously added skip, delete its line and run: /etc/init.d/nrsyncd reload
	# Avoid blank lines like 'list skip_iface' with no value (they are ignored).

 	# list skip_iface 'phy0-ap1'
```

Live changes: Most runtime tunables (intervals, jitter, debug, umdns refresh, settle delay, skip_iface) can be reloaded without a full restart:

```sh
uci set nrsyncd.global.update_interval=45
uci commit nrsyncd
/etc/init.d/nrsyncd reload   # sends SIGHUP; daemon re-reads UCI values
```

Full restart still required only if you change structural aspects before daemon start (e.g. enabling/disabling service) or to clear internal state forcibly.

Environment mapping (init script ‚Üí daemon) ‚Äì new primary names with legacy (`RRM_NR_*`) still exported for backward compatibility in 1.0.x (deprecated 2025-10-01):
- `NRSYNCD_UPDATE_INTERVAL` ‚Üí `UPDATE_INTERVAL`
- `NRSYNCD_JITTER_MAX` ‚Üí `JITTER_MAX`
- `NRSYNCD_DEBUG` ‚Üí enables debug log path
- `NRSYNCD_UMDNS_REFRESH_INTERVAL` ‚Üí `UMDNS_REFRESH_INTERVAL`
- `NRSYNCD_QUICK_MAX_MS` ‚Üí max milliseconds spent in first-pass adaptive iface readiness (default 2000, cap 5000)
- `NRSYNCD_SECOND_PASS_MS` ‚Üí delay in milliseconds before the targeted second-pass fetch (default 800, cap 1500)

All options are optional; defaults are compiled into the script.

Numeric validation & bounds:
- update_interval: minimum 5 enforced (values <5 auto-raised to 5)
- jitter_max: capped to half of effective update_interval
- umdns_refresh_interval: minimum 5 enforced
- umdns_settle_delay: forced >=0 (negative coerced to 0)
Out-of-range values are sanitized silently; check `/etc/init.d/nrsyncd status` after reload for effective applied values.

### Deprecation Timeline ‚è≥

Legacy artifacts retained for a single transition window:

Item | Status in 1.0.0 | Deprecation Date | Action After Date
-----|-----------------|------------------|------------------
`RRM_NR_*` environment variables | Supported (alias to NRSYNCD_*) | 2025-10-01 | Will be removed in a minor release; update scripts to `NRSYNCD_*`.
`_rrm_nr._udp` mDNS browse fallback | Supported (fallback only) | 2025-10-01 | Removal planned; discovery must use `_nrsyncd_v1._udp`.
Unversioned `_nrsyncd._udp` | Never deployed | N/A | Do not rely on this name.

`rrm_nr_*` ubus method names remain indefinitely (tied to hostapd expectations) until upstream hostapd gains a native rename.

### Skipping Interfaces üö´

Add one `list skip_iface '<iface>'` per interface (names are the portion after `hostapd.`). Example:

```
config nrsyncd 'global'
	list skip_iface 'wlan0'
	list skip_iface 'wlan1-1'
```

You may (optionally) include a `hostapd.` prefix; it will be stripped automatically (e.g. `hostapd.wlan0`).

Notes / behavior:
- Order and duplicates are normalized; the effective set is visible via `/etc/init.d/nrsyncd skiplist`.
- A blank `list skip_iface` without a value is ignored (no error); remove such lines to keep the config tidy.
- Changes take effect on `/etc/init.d/nrsyncd reload` (SIGHUP) without a full restart.

Skipped interfaces are omitted from TXT assembly and neighbor list updates.

On startup and reload, if any interfaces are skipped you'll see an additional log line:

```
Skip list: wlan0 wlan1-1
```

Note: The runtime status file still reports the environment variable as `skip_ifaces=` internally; this is only a naming artifact and maps to the configured `list skip_iface` entries.

### Service Commands üõ†Ô∏è

Command | Purpose | Notes
--------|---------|------
`status` | Show runtime state + embedded metrics | Reads `/tmp/nrsyncd_runtime` & metrics snapshot
`summary` | One‚Äëline health overview (push/suppress/cache/remote/neighbor stats) | Fast parse for scripts
`metrics` | Raw metrics file contents | For detailed monitoring ingestion
`mapping` | Live iface ‚Üí BSSID / channel / width / center1 / SSID table | Uses iwinfo + ubus
`mapping_json` | JSON array variant of mapping | Alias: `mapping-json`
`neighbors` | Dump current per‚Äëiface neighbor lists (JSON) | After self‚Äëfilter
`cache` | Show per‚ÄëSSID cached list files | Includes mtime + sample head
`refresh` | Force immediate update cycle (SIGUSR1) | No timing wait
`reset_metrics` | Reset counters & remote uniqueness (SIGUSR2) | Keeps cache/data intact
`diag` / `timing_check` | Readiness probe timings for each iface | Alias: `timing-check`
`skiplist` | Effective configured skip_iface entries | Normalized view
`version` | Init script version (and git hash if available) | Sync with release tag
`metadata` | Show parsed live mDNS TXT advertisement (SSIDn tokens + metadata v/c/h) | Useful to verify ordering and hash

### Reloading Configuration ‚Üª

`/etc/init.d/nrsyncd reload` triggers a SIGHUP which now:

1. Re-reads UCI for: update_interval, jitter_max, umdns_refresh_interval, umdns_settle_delay, debug, skip_iface.
2. Applies sanity caps (min 5s interval; jitter ‚â§ half interval; umdns refresh ‚â•5s).
3. Rebuilds interface‚ÜíSSID mapping and reapplies skip list.
4. Logs a concise before‚Üíafter summary (`Reload (SIGHUP): U=60 J=10 ... -> U=45 J=5 ...`). If any timing shrinks, the current sleep is interrupted for an immediate cycle.

Status:
```
/etc/init.d/nrsyncd status
```
Shows current effective runtime values (from `/tmp/nrsyncd_runtime`).

Next cycle uses the new timing immediately; current sleep is unaffected until next iteration (keeps logic simple and race‚Äëfree).

## Example Wireless Config Snippet üë®üèª‚Äçüè´

See `examples/wireless.config` for a dual‚Äëband setup. Key lines:
```
option ieee80211k '1'
option bss_transition '1'
option time_advertisement '2'
```

## Troubleshooting üßë‚Äçüîß

Symptom | Check
--------|------
Service never starts | `logread` for errors about missing `/etc/config/wireless` or zero interfaces.
Hangs at "Waiting for all wireless interfaces" | `ubus list hostapd.*` count vs enabled `wifi-iface` stanzas; ensure no disabled ones assumed active.
Missing TXT records | Confirm `umdns` running and firewall allows mDNS; inspect assembly by temporarily adding a `logger -t nrsyncd "$rrm_own"` before `procd_open_instance`.
Immediate restart with wpad restart | Likely ubus exit code 4 from `rrm_nr_get_own`; watch for upstream OpenWrt bug reference (see init script comment).

## Runtime Metrics üìä

Metrics are written to `/tmp/nrsyncd_metrics` each cycle (atomic rename). Fields:

Field | Meaning | Notes
------|---------|------
`cycle` | Number of update cycles completed | Increments once per full loop
`cache_hits` | Times a per-SSID group list matched existing cache | Diff done on whitespace-stripped JSON
`cache_misses` | Times a per-SSID list changed (or forced) and was rewritten | Includes forced writes from empty -> populated
`nr_sets_sent` | Per-interface neighbor lists actually pushed to hostapd | Baseline + subsequent changes
`nr_sets_suppressed` | Candidate per-interface updates skipped because list unchanged | Grows with stable environment
`remote_entries_merged` | Cumulative count of remote TXT lines ingested | Adds each cycle; not unique count
`remote_unique_cycle` | Distinct remote TXT entries observed in the most recent cycle | After per-cycle `sort -u`
`remote_unique_total` | Cumulative distinct remote TXT entries since daemon start | Backed by on-disk seen set
`last_update_time` | Epoch of most recent successful hostapd rrm_nr_set call | 0 until first push
`baseline_ssids` | Count of distinct SSIDs that received a baseline push this process | Ensures each SSID delivered once even if no diff
`suppression_ratio_pct` | Integer percent = suppressed / (sent+suppressed) * 100 | 0 when no updates yet
`nr_set_failures` | Count of failed `rrm_nr_set` ubus calls | Inspect logs if non‚Äëzero; indicates hostapd rejection or transient ubus issues
`neighbor_count_<iface>` | Post self‚Äëfilter neighbor list size for interface `<iface>` | One dynamic key per active, non‚Äëskipped interface

Interpretation tips:
- A high `suppression_ratio_pct` (e.g. >95%) indicates a stable environment (expected after convergence).
- `baseline_ssids` should equal the number of distinct SSIDs served locally (after a fresh start). If smaller, check logs for missing SSID mapping lines.
- `remote_entries_merged` will typically be (#remote TXT lines) * cycles; large growth alone is not an issue.
- If `nr_sets_sent` stalls at 0 while `cache_misses` increments, hostapd `rrm_nr_set` may be failing (enable debug and inspect logs).
- Non‚Äëzero `nr_set_failures` warrants checking `logread -e nrsyncd` for rejection causes.
- `neighbor_count_<iface>` lets you quickly spot asymmetric visibility (e.g. one radio consistently sees fewer peers).

Ordering & Dedupe:
- Neighbor lists are now deterministically ordered by (SSID, BSSID) and duplicate SSID+BSSID pairs arriving from multiple remote sources are suppressed to a single entry.
- Per‚Äëinterface lists exclude that interface‚Äôs own BSSID triplet; counts reflect only true neighbors.

Example excerpt (with newer fields):
```
cycle=37
cache_hits=96
cache_misses=2
nr_sets_sent=3
nr_sets_suppressed=102
remote_entries_merged=111
remote_unique_cycle=3
remote_unique_total=7
last_update_time=1756609138
baseline_ssids=2
suppression_ratio_pct=97
nr_set_failures=0
neighbor_count_phy0-ap0=4
neighbor_count_phy0-ap1=3
neighbor_count_phy1-ap0=4
```

In this example two SSIDs had baseline delivery, three interfaces received initial lists, and subsequent interface-level opportunities were mostly suppressed (97% stability). Remote uniqueness indicates 7 distinct remote entries seen cumulatively, 3 present in the latest cycle.

### Summary Command ‚àë

`/etc/init.d/nrsyncd summary` prints a single concise line aggregating key counters, uniqueness and neighbor distribution stats. Example:

```
summary: cycles=37 pushes=3 suppressed=102 suppression=97% cache(hit/miss)=96/2 baseline_ssids=2 remote(entries=111 uniq_cycle=3 uniq_total=7) failures=0 neigh(min=3@phy0-ap1 max=4@phy0-ap0,phy1-ap0 avg=3 ifaces=3) last_update=1756609138
```

Field groups:
- `cycles` / `pushes` / `suppressed` / `suppression`: High suppression with low failures indicates convergence.
- `cache(hit/miss)`: Misses correspond to per‚ÄëSSID list mutations (or baseline). Persistent misses imply churn.
- `baseline_ssids`: Distinct SSIDs baseline‚Äëdelivered this process (should match local distinct SSIDs after first cycle).
- `remote(entries=E uniq_cycle=C uniq_total=T)`: Raw remote TXT lines merged, distinct in current cycle, and cumulative distinct since start (normalized).
- `failures`: Count of hostapd `rrm_nr_set` failures. Non‚Äëzero warrants log inspection.
- `neigh(min=MIN@ifaces max=MAX@ifaces avg=AVG ifaces=N)`: Post self‚Äëfilter neighbor list sizes across active interfaces (min/max list the interface names; multiple if comma‚Äëseparated). Large disparity may indicate RF isolation or configuration differences.
- `last_update`: Epoch seconds for most recent successful neighbor list push.

Use the summary for quick health checks (automation, monitoring) without parsing the full metrics file.

## Security / Scope üîê

- Read‚Äëonly interaction with hostapd via `ubus` (`rrm_nr_get_own`, `rrm_nr_set` to push lists). Does not modify wireless configuration.
- Writes ephemeral state only under `/tmp` (`/tmp/nrsyncd_state`, `/tmp/nrsyncd_metrics`, `/tmp/nrsyncd_runtime`); no persistent data besides optional config.
- mDNS exposure limited to TXT records enumerating encoded NR data; no management frames transmitted directly.
- No credentials or sensitive secrets handled; logging omits raw neighbor hex beyond what hostapd already provides.

## Versioning & Release üöÄ

See `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for detailed history and `docs/DEVELOPER.md` for the full release checklist. Upgrade from pre‚Äërebrand versions generally requires replacing `service/nrsyncd.init` (formerly `service/rrm_nr.init`), `bin/nrsyncd` (formerly `bin/rrm_nr`), and `lib/nrsyncd_common.sh`, then restarting (`/etc/init.d/nrsyncd restart`). Baseline pushes will repopulate hostapd lists and metrics reset automatically. Legacy env vars are still exported for backward compatibility this release.

## Extending & Future Ideas üå±

High‚Äëlevel ideas (details and additional guidance in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`):

- Per‚Äëinterface opt‚Äëout (planned) via `option nrsyncd_disable '1'`.
- Additional feature TXT flags appended after SSID arguments.
- Retry logic for non‚Äë4 ubus failures (bounded, minimally noisy).

## Design Notes üìù

- Delimiter `+` is intentional (invalid in SSIDs) ‚Äì do not change; consumers rely on ordered `SSIDn=` prefix positions.
- Minimal dependencies: BusyBox POSIX shell only (avoid `[[` and arrays). `jsonfilter` is assumed present on OpenWrt.
- Assumes hostapd exposes `rrm_nr_get_own`; if upstream API changes, a fallback probe sequence will be added.
- Adaptive readiness / retry algorithm & detailed assembly log line formats are documented in `docs/DEVELOPER.md` (see "Neighbor Assembly & Adaptive Retry").

### Persistence Across Upgrades (sysupgrade) üÜï

To keep files across firmware flashes, add these lines to `/etc/sysupgrade.conf` (or use `sh scripts/install.sh --add-sysupgrade`):
```
/etc/init.d/nrsyncd
/usr/bin/nrsyncd
/lib/nrsyncd_common.sh
```
Note: UCI configs in `/etc/config/*` (including `/etc/config/nrsyncd`) are already preserved by sysupgrade; no need to list them.

Manual addition:
```sh
for f in /etc/init.d/nrsyncd /usr/bin/nrsyncd /lib/nrsyncd_common.sh; do
	grep -qx "$f" /etc/sysupgrade.conf || echo "$f" >> /etc/sysupgrade.conf
done
```

Verify later:
```sh
grep nrsyncd /etc/sysupgrade.conf
```

### Installing Dependencies (opkg / apk) üì¶

Runtime tools normally present: `ubus`, `jsonfilter`, `iwinfo`, `umdns`. If missing:

Using opkg (traditional):
```sh
opkg update
opkg install umdns jsonfilter iwinfo
```

Using apk (emerging images):
```sh
apk update
apk add umdns jsonfilter iwinfo
```

Optional high-resolution sleep:
```sh
opkg install coreutils-sleep   # or
apk add coreutils
```

## Limitations ‚è∏Ô∏è

Summary (full discussion and future roadmap ideas in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`):
- Large deployments (>20 AP) may see slower convergence.
- Binary daemon is prebuilt (no current source in repo).
- Remote ingestion relies on mDNS reachability; packet loss can delay uniqueness visibility.
- Very large remote sets could inflate lists (future cap option contemplated).

## Quick One‚ÄëLiner (Elevator Pitch) üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíº

Collect each hostapd's 802.11k neighbor report and advertise them via mDNS TXT records so peer APs (same ESS) can rapidly share steering hints.
